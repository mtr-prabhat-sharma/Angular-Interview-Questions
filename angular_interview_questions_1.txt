QUES 1: What are decorators in Angular ?
ANS 1: Angular decorators are a feature that was introduced in Angular 2.0.
They are a way to add metadata to classes, methods, properties, and parameters.
This metadata can then be used by Angular to perform certain actions, 
such as logging, caching, or routing.

There are 4 types of decorators in Angular
1-Class decorators, such as @Component and @NgModule
2-Property decorators for properties inside classes, such as @Input and @Output
3-Method decorators for methods inside classes, such as @HostListener
4-Parameter decorators for parameters inside class constructors, such as @Injectable

QUES 2: What are Route Guards in Angular ?
ANS 2: Route guards in Angular are a way to control access to routes based on 
certain conditions.
Route guard is used to grant or remove access from certain parts of the application.
Like we want our app to stop unauthorized users from accessing the protected route.
There are 4 types of Route Guards in Angular:
1 - CanActivate: User must be logged in before accessing the particular route.
2 - CanActivateChild: It is used to guard child routes.
3 - CanDeactivate:The Angular CanDeactivate guard is a service that can be used to 
                  prevent users from navigating away from a route/page in your 
                  application. For example, if the page contains a text editor with 
                  unsaved changes or an unsubmitted form, you can use the 
                  CanDeactivate guard to prevent the user from navigating away from 
                  the page until they have saved their changes or submitted the form.
4 - AngularResolver/Resolve: It prefetches the data before navigating to the route. 
                             So that component will render along with the data.
