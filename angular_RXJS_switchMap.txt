SWITCH MAP
SwitchMap works same as mergeMap, the only diference is that it cancels all the previous 
observables whenever a new observable event occurs.
switchMap is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to cancel the previous 
observable (e.g., an ongoing HTTP request) when a new event occurs. It's a powerful 
operator for handling asynchronous operations in Angular applications.
